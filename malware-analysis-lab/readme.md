#  Reverse TCP Shell & Basic Malware Behaviour Analysis  
*A beginner-friendly cybersecurity home lab project using Kali Linux & Windows*

---

  Overview
This project demonstrates a **beginner-level malware behaviour analysis** and **reverse TCP shell simulation** performed in a **controlled virtual cybersecurity lab**.

Using:

- **Kali Linux** (Attacker VM)  
- **Windows 10/11** (Victim VM)  
- **Internal Virtual Network**  
- **Reverse TCP Payload**  
- **Python HTTP Server**  
- **Nmap for reconnaissance**  
- **Optional: Splunk for telemetry**

  Tools Used

| Category | Tools |
|---------|-------|
| Operating Systems | Kali Linux, Windows 11 |
| Reconnaissance | Nmap |
| Payload Generation | Msfvenom |
| Delivery | Python HTTP Server |
| Interaction | Reverse TCP Shell |
| Windows Commands | netstat, ipconfig, net user |
| Optional Logging | Splunk Universal Forwarder |

---
This project focuses on understanding:

- How attackers find targets  
- How payloads are generated and delivered  
- How reverse shells work  
- What Windows does when a malicious payload runs  
- Network communication between attacker and victim  
- How logs/telemetry appear during these events  

Learning Outcomes

- Understanding of basic malware execution behaviour
- How reverse TCP shells work
- How attackers deliver payloads
- Network scanning & service enumeration
- How Windows responds to malicious payloads
- Fundamentals of incident investigation
Optional: how events appear in Splunk/SIEM
