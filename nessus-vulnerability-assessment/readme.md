# Nessus Vulnerability Assessment  
*A practical cybersecurity project demonstrating vulnerability scanning with Nessus Essentials*

---

##  Project Overview

This project showcases a **vulnerability assessment** conducted using **Tenable Nessus**, one of the most widely used vulnerability scanning tools in the industry. Nessus helps identify known security weaknesses, misconfigurations, missing patches, and potential attack vectors in target systems. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

The main goal of this project was to:

- Scan a target host for vulnerabilities  
- Analyse the severity and impact of discovered issues  
- Understand how Nessus reports vulnerabilities  
- Document and interpret findings in a structured way  
- Practice vulnerability assessment workflows used by security analysts

##  Tools & Environment

| Component | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Vulnerability Scanner | **Tenable Nessus Essentials** |
| Target System | Virtual Machine (e.g., Windows/Linux VM) |
| Host Environment | Local lab setup (VirtualBox / VMware) |
| Reporting | Nessus HTML/PDF Scan Reports |

**Note:** Nessus Essentials is a free version of Nessus that allows scanning of a limited number of IPs but includes the full vulnerability database and reporting engine. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

##  What Was Done

The vulnerability assessment project involved the following major steps:

1. **Setup Virtual Lab**  
   Configure a virtual environment with target systems and ensure network connectivity.

2. **Install & Configure Nessus**  
   Installed Nessus Essentials on the host system and activated it using the Nessus web interface on port `8834`. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

3. **Create Scan Policy**  
   Created a Basic Network Scan or custom policy for the target.

4. **Run Vulnerability Scan**  
   Executed a scan against the target IP address to discover open ports, outdated services, and potential security weaknesses. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

5. **Analyze Results**  
   Reviewed the Nessus scan results, focusing on high and critical severity vulnerabilities (classified using CVSS scoring).

6. **Documentation & Reporting**  
   Exported and documented findings, including vulnerability descriptions, severity, affected services, and suggested remediation guidance.

##  Key Findings

The Nessus scan identified multiple issues across different severity levels, including:

- **Critical vulnerabilities** – High-impact issues requiring urgent remediation  
- **High severity** – Important flaws that could lead to compromise  
- **Medium & Low severity** – Lesser issues often associated with configuration weaknesses  
- **Informational notes** – Contextual insights into system state

(You can provide your specific findings and counts here — e.g., number of critical, high, medium vulnerabilities, etc.)

##  Report & Artifacts

The repository contains the following key artifacts:

- `nessus-scan-report.pdf` — Full scan export report  
- `high-risk-findings.md` — Summary of critical and high severity vulnerabilities  
- `remediation-guidance.md` — Suggested mitigation steps for issues discovered  
- Screenshots directory — Visual evidence of scans and dashboard results

##  What You Will Learn

After completing this project, you will understand:

- How to use Nessus Essentials for vulnerability scanning  
- How to interpret Nessus scan results and CVSS scores  
- What common vulnerability types look like (e.g., missing patches, exposed services, weak configurations)  
- How to document assessment findings like a cybersecurity analyst

##  Ethics & Responsible Use

> This assessment was conducted in a controlled lab environment on virtual machines that I own and manage.  
> Never perform unauthorized scanning or vulnerability assessment on systems you do not legally own or have permission to test.

##  Next Steps (Optional)

If you want to extend this project, you could:

- Perform **credentialed scans** (with authenticated access) to get deeper insights  
- Run **remediation and re-scans** to confirm fixes  
- Compare Nessus results with other tools like OpenVAS or Qualys  
- Integrate reporting into a vulnerability management workflow
