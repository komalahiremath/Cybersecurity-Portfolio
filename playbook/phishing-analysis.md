## Phishing Email Triage: Header & Payload Analysis

###  Objective
Demonstrate structured phishing triage process using:
- Header inspection
- IOC enrichment
- Payload evaluation

###  Scenario Details
- Spoofed email from `hr@infotechScareers.co`
- Subject: “URGENT: Updated Salary Review”
- Attachment: `salaryreview.xlsm`
- URL in body: `http://infotech-secure-login.com`

###  Analysis Steps
1. **Header Review**
   - SPF/DKIM/DMARC fail
   - IP from non-authorized server
   - `Reply-To` mismatch
2. **Payload & Link Review**
   - `.xlsm` file flagged in VirusTotal (6/68 engines)
   - URL redirects to credential-harvesting page (via URLScan)

###  IOCs Extracted
- SHA256 hash of attachment
- IP address of malicious site
- Suspicious domain

###  Automation Plan (Python-based)
- Extract links & attachments
- Hash and check via VirusTotal API
- Log unknowns, alert on known-bads
