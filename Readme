#  Cybersecurity Portfolio  
A collection of hands-on cybersecurity projects demonstrating skills in malware analysis, network security, threat detection, packet analysis, and blue-team operations.  
This portfolio highlights my practical learning and showcases real-world defensive techniques used by SOC and Cyber Defence teams.

##  Project Overview

### 1.  Malware Analysis  
**File:** `malware-analysis/virustotal-YARA.md`  
A step-by-step analysis of a malicious PDF file using **VirusTotal**, **YARA rules**, and basic malware triage techniques.  
This project demonstrates:  
- Identifying malicious indicators inside a suspicious file  
- Writing and applying custom YARA signatures  
- Understanding malware behaviour and threat classification  

---

### 2.  OSI Layers – Attacks & Controls  
**File:** `osi-layers-attacks-controls/osi-layer-attack-control-matrix.md`  
A clear breakdown of the **OSI model**, common cyber attacks at each layer, and best-practice security controls.  
This project demonstrates:  
- Strong foundational knowledge in networking  
- Mapping cyber threats to network layers  
- Understanding defensive mechanisms like Firewalls, IDS/IPS, Port Security, VLANs, etc.  

---

### 3.  Wireshark Network Traffic Analysis  
**File:** `wireshark/network-traffic.md`  
A practical project analysing packet captures (PCAP) using **Wireshark**.  
Includes:  
- Identifying normal vs suspicious network behaviour  
- Understanding protocols (TCP, DNS, HTTP, ARP)  
- Recognizing signs of scanning, spoofing, and anomalies  

This demonstrates practical **network forensics** and packet-level understanding — a core SOC skill.

##  Purpose of This Portfolio
This portfolio highlights my transition into cybersecurity by showing real practical skills rather than just theory.  
Each project is designed to reflect tasks performed by:
- SOC Analysts  
- Incident Responders  
- Cyber Defence Analysts  
- Blue Team Engineers
