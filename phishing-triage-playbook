## ✉️ Use Case 1 – Phishing Triage: Header & Payload Analysis

### 📌 Objective
Demonstrate structured phishing triage process using:

   - `Reply-To` mismatch
2. **Payload & Link Review**
   - `.xlsm` file flagged in VirusTotal (6/68 engines)
   - URL redirects to credential-harvesting page (via URLScan)

### 🧠 IOCs Extracted
- SHA256 hash of attachment
- IP address of malicious site
- Suspicious domain

### 🤖 Automation Plan (Python-based)
